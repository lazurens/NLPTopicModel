# Topic Modeling (Supervised vs Unsupervised):
There is two LDAs for both types of learning, yet they are totally different.
- Supervised (LDA) stands for: Linear Discriminant Analysis
- UnSupervised (LDA) stands for: Latent Dirichlet Allocation
So in our case inorder to extract the topics without any humain intervention, we need the Unsupervised learning version of topic modeling "Latent Dirichlet Allocation".

## Overview : Topic modeling with LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
In LDA, each document may be viewed as a mixture of various topics where each document is considered to have a set of topics that are assigned to it via LDA. This is identical to probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA), except that in LDA the topic distribution is assumed to have a sparse Dirichlet prior. The sparse Dirichlet priors encode the intuition that documents cover only a small set of topics and that topics use only a small set of words frequently. In practice, this results in a better disambiguation of words and a more precise assignment of documents to topics. LDA is a generalisation of the pLSA model, which is equivalent to LDA under a uniform Dirichlet prior distribution.

For example, an LDA model might have topics that can be classified as Developement_related and freedom_related. A topic has probabilities of generating various words, such as growth, evolution, and increase, which can be classified and interpreted by the viewer as "Development_related".

Each tweets is assumed to be characterized by a particular set of topics. This is makes it part of the standard bag of words model assumption, and makes the individual words exchangeable.

# Packages:

  - topicmodels : An R Package for Fitting Topic Models.
  - LDAvis : R package for interactive topic model visualization.

# Steps of implementation: 

  - Tweets Collection/aqcuizition
  - Preprocessing : Tokenization and Stopwords
  - Vector Space : (Corpus Bag of words)
  - Model : LDA (R packages: gensim, topicmodels ...)
  - Evaluation
  - Visualization

# Progress of implementation: 

  - Tweets Collection/aqcuizition : Done :)
  - Preprocessing : Done (Can be improved)
  - Vector Space : Done
  - Model : Done
  - Evaluation : Manually done with no measures
  - Visualization : Inprogress
    - State: Trying to apply the visualization on an example that works with correct parameters and apply the code on our tweets.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Breakdance](http://breakdance.io) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ npm run predeploy
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md] [PlDb] |
| Github | [plugins/github/README.md] [PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md] [PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md] [PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md] [PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md] [PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 80, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 80 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud

See [KUBERNETES.md](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/blob/master/KUBERNETES.md)
